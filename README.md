# Customer-Segmentation
Python and Power BI

While working in a company that serves goods to thousands of customers in several countries, I wanted to create a tool that would be useful to the sales managers in those countries by quickly showcasing what customers to contact next, in order to grow sales and customer retention. That is how I came to know about RFM analysis.

RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries.

This project focuses on doing RFM analysis on company sales and creating a data visualization dashboard showcasing customer segmentation that I can share with colleagues in the countries.
